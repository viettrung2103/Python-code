# Write a program for fetching and storing airport data. The program asks the user if they want to enter a new airport,
# fetch the information of an existing airport or quit. If the user chooses to enter a new airport,
# the program asks the user to enter the ICAO code and name of the airport. If the user chooses to fetch airport information instead,
# the program asks for the ICAO code of the airport and prints out the corresponding name.
# If the user chooses to quit, the program execution ends. The user can choose a new option as many times they want until they choose to quit.
# (The ICAO code is an identifier that is unique to each airport. For example, the ICAO code of Helsinki-Vantaa Airport is EFHK.
# You can easily find the ICAO codes of different airports online.)
