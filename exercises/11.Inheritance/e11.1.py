# Implement the following class hierarchy using Python:
# A publication can be either a book or a magazine.
# Each publication has a name. Each book also has an author and a page count
# , whereas each magazine has a chief editor. Also write the required initializers to both classes.
# Create a print_information method to both subclasses for printing out all information of the publication
# in question. In the main program, create publications Donald Duck (chief editor Aki Hyyppä)
# and Compartment No. 6 (author Rosa Liksom, 192 pages). Print out all information of both publications using the methods you implemented.
