# Extend the previosly written Car class by adding two subclasses: ElectricCar and GasolineCar.
# Electric cars have the capacity of the battery in kilowatt-hours as their property.
# Gasoline cars have the volume of the tank in liters as their property.
# Write initializers for the subclasses. For example, the initializer of electric cars receives the registration number,
# maximum speed and battery capacity as its parameter. It calls the initializer of the base class to set the first two properties and then sets its capacity.
# Write a main program where you create one electric car (ABC-15, 180 km/h, 52.5 kWh) and one gasoline car (ACD-123, 165 km/h, 32.3 l).
# Select speeds for both cars, make them drive for three hours and print out the values of their kilometer counters.
