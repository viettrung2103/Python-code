# Now we will program a car race. The travelled distance of a new car is initialized as zero.
# At the beginning of the main program, create a list that consists of 10 car objects created using a loop.
# The maximum speed of each new car is a random value between 100 km/h and 200 km/h.
# The registration numbers are created as follows: "ABC-1", "ABC-2" and so on. Now the race begins.
# One per every hour of the race, the following operations are performed:
#
# The speed of each car is changed so that the change in speed is a random value between -10 km/h and +15 km/h. This is done using the accerelate method.
# Each car is made to drive for one hour. This is done with the drive method.
